# CPFA_Pipeline
Pipeline for the statistical testing of cis-pair enrichment


You will need:
  - a species genome
  - a set of regions of interest such as DHS or peaks from DNase- or ATAC-SEQ for example or promoter regions
  - a motif database in meme form (such as Jaspar)
  - your gene sets of interest in which you want to find enrichments
  
  
 The tools offer a wrapper to handle the full pipeline or each step can be run individually if required.
